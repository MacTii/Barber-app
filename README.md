---
An application that supports a hairdressing salon with one hairdresser. The salon is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and each visit lasts for an hour.
Customers report (and withdraw) the dates of the visits they would like to make. The clients can see the current status of the hairdresser's activities
(the client screen shows the change of view after each one updating the hairdresser's schedule).
The server sends messages about reserved and withdrawn services (and dates) to all clients, causing a refresh
customer view. The program includes appropriate synchronization of access to resources and their updates. 
The application performance was taken care of: CPU consumption and network link usage.
